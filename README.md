# Dreams and Demons

## What is it?
My name is **Abdullah Ar Rayhan**. Dreams and Demons is a personal website created and maintained by myself, an aspiring Web Developer who, in his spare time, reads Science Fictions and Political Philosophy and watches Films and Drama shows.

This website is a reflection of my thoughts on how I view the world around me. It's also a way to implement my Web Development skills into practice. In this website, I'll be writing about social norms and political interpretation of events as well as about the books, films and shows I watch.

At the time of writing this, I am still quite new to Web Development but I intend to turn it into a fully functional website with time as I go on acquiring new skillset. Right now, the project is not interactive but I would highly appreciate feedbacks from the learned as to how I might improve certain things or do some things differently.
